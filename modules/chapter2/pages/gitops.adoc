= ArgoCD Plugin

The RHDH ArgoCD plugin provides a read-only visualization of your ArgoCD and OpenShift GitOps application deployments in the RHDH web UI. This allows developers to get quick feedback about their application deployment status without ever leaving the RHDH web UI. The plugin displays the latest deployment status, as well as information about historical deployments. Developers can easily identify deployments that failed and take quick, remedial action.

When importing ArgoCD `Application` resources into RHDH, you must ensure that you have a `argocd/app-name` annotation in your catalog YAML descriptor files that match the name of the ArgoCD `Application` resource.

== Lab: Configuring the Tekton Plugin

=== Pre-requisites

* Install the `Red Hat OpenShift GitOps` operator by following the official product documentation at https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_gitops/1.13/html-single/installing_gitops/index#installing-openshift-gitops. Use default values outlined in the installation guide. You must have an ArgoCD instance running in the `openshift-gitops` namespace before continuing with the next steps.

=== Steps

. Install *Argo CD* operator in Red Hat OpenShift.

.. Log in to Red Hat OpenShift Console and navigate to the *Operators* and select *OperatorHub*:

.. Search for *Argo CD* operator in OperatorHub:
+
image:argo.png[title=Argo CD operator]

.. Install the operator and once done move to the next step.

. Log in to the OpenShift cluster as the cluster administrator using the `oc` CLI.

. Download and inspect the sample ArgoCD application at https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/devhub-qc-apps/blob/main/gitops/argo-app.yaml. You can use your own custom application if you wish. Just ensure that the annotation's in your catalog YAML file match the application name. Note the labels for this ArgoCD app. You will need to match the labels on this resource with the RHDH ArgoCD plugin, so that it can identify this ArgoCD app and fetch details about its state.

. You will deploy a sample application in the `myapps` namespace. To allow OpenShift GitOps to manage resources in this namespace, add a label as follows:
+
====
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
oc label namespace myapps \
  argocd.argoproj.io/managed-by=openshift-gitops
----
====

. Create the ArgoCD application in the `openshift-gitops` namespace.
+
====
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
oc apply -f argo-app.yaml -n openshift-gitops
----
====

. Get the auto-generated password for the ArgoCD instance created by the OpenShift GitOps operator:
+
====
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
oc extract secret/openshift-gitops-cluster -n openshift-gitops --to=-
----
====

. Edit the `rhdh-secrets` Secret resource in the `devhub` namespace and add key/value for accessing the  ArgoCD instance:

  ARGOCD_ADMIN_USER=admin
  ARGCOD_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<password from the previous step>

. Edit the `app-config-rhdh` ConfigMap and configure the ArgoCD plugin at the same indentation level as the `app` and `kubernetes` attributes:
+
====
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
argocd:
      waitCycles: 25
      appLocatorMethods:
        - type: 'config'
          instances:
            - name: argocd1 <1>
              url: https://openshift-gitops-server-openshift-gitops.apps.cluster-<guid>.dynamic.redhatworkshops.io <2>
              username: ${ARGOCD_ADMIN_USER} <3>
              password: ${ARGCOD_ADMIN_PASSWORD} <4>
----
====
+
<1> A unique name for this ArgoCD instance. You can define multiple ArgoCD instances under the `instances:` key
<2> The URL of the ArgoCD instance (Run `oc get route openshift-gitops-server -n openshift-gitops` to the full route URL)
<3> Username for this ArgoCD instance. Default is `admin`
<4> Password for this ArgoCD instance.

. Enable the following three ArgoCD plugins in the dynamic plugin YAML configuration:
+
====
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
- package: './dynamic-plugins/dist/roadiehq-backstage-plugin-argo-cd'
    disabled: false
  - package: './dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-community-plugin-redhat-argocd'
    disabled: false
  - package: './dynamic-plugins/dist/roadiehq-backstage-plugin-argo-cd-backend-dynamic'
    disabled: false
----
====

. Restart the RHDH pod from the `Topology` view. Wait until the RHDH container is fully up and running.

. Finally, inspect the catalog YAML descriptor file for this component at https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/devhub-qc-apps/blob/main/gitops/catalog-info.yaml. Adjust the values for your environment. Note the `argocd/app-selector` annotation to match the labels on the ArgoCD `Application` resource (`app=spring-petclinic`).
+
====
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: spring-petclinic-gitops
  title: An app deployed by OpenShift GitOps
  description: |
    This is a simple spring app deployed by OCP GitOps
  annotations:
    backstage.io/kubernetes-id: 'spring-petclinic'
    backstage.io/kubernetes-namespace: myapps
    backstage.io/kubernetes-label-selector: 'app=spring-petclinic'
    argocd/app-selector: 'app=spring-petclinic'
spec:
...
----
====

. Import the component into the RHDH catalog from the `Create > Register Existing Component` page, and provide the full path to the `catalog-info.yml` file from the previous step. After the component is imported, verify that the component is listed in the `Catalog` page and click on `An app deployed by OpenShift GitOps` to view the component details.

. Verify that you can see a new `ArgoCD overview` and `Deployment Summary` sections in the `Overview` tab that shows the sync status and health status for this application.
+

. You should see a new tab named `CD` in this page. Click on it to view the details for the ArgoCD application.

. You can click the link next to `spring-petclinic` to view the details in the ArgoCD dashboard.
