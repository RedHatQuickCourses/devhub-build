= ArgoCD Plugin

The RHDH ArgoCD plugin provides a read-only visualization of your ArgoCD and OpenShift GitOps application deployments in the RHDH web UI. This allows developers to get quick feedback about their application deployment status without ever leaving the RHDH web UI. The plugin displays the latest deployment status, as well as information about historical deployments. Developers can easily identify deployments that failed and take quick, remedial action.

When importing ArgoCD `Application` resources into RHDH, you must ensure that you have a `argocd/app-name` annotation in your catalog YAML descriptor files that match the name of the ArgoCD `Application` resource.

== Lab: Configuring the Tekton Plugin

=== Pre-requisites

* Install the `Red Hat OpenShift GitOps` operator by following the official product documentation at https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_gitops/1.11/html-single/installing_gitops/index#installing-gitops-operator-in-web-console_installing-openshift-gitops. Use default values outlined in the installation guide. You must have an ArgoCD instance running in the `openshift-gitops` namespace before continuing with the next steps.

=== Steps

. Log in to the OpenShift cluster as the cluster administrator using the `oc` CLI.

. Download and inspect the sample ArgoCD application at https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/devhub-qc-apps/blob/main/gitops/argo-app.yaml. You can use your own custom application if you wish. Just ensure that the annotation's in your catalog YAML file match the application name.

. Create the application in the `openshift-gitops` namespace.

  $ oc apply -f argo-app.yaml -n openshift-gitops

. Get the auto-generated password for the ArgoCD instance created by the OpenShift GitOps operator:

  $ oc extract secret/openshift-gitops-cluster -n openshift-gitops --to=-

. Edit the `rhdh-secrets` Secret resource in the `devhub` namespace and add key/value for accessing the  ArgoCD instance:

  ARGOCD_ADMIN_USER=admin
  ARGCOD_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<password from the previous step>

. Edit the `app-config-rhdh` ConfigMap and configure the ArgoCD plugin:
+
```yaml
argocd:
      waitCycles: 25
      appLocatorMethods:
        - type: 'config'
          instances:
            - name: argocd1 <1>
              url: https://openshift-gitops-server-openshift-gitops.apps.cluster-6tkk4.dynamic.redhatworkshops.io <2>
              username: ${ARGOCD_ADMIN_USER} <3>
              password: ${ARGCOD_ADMIN_PASSWORD} <4>
```
+
<1> A unique name for this ArgoCD instance. You can define multiple ArgoCD instances under the `instances:` key
<2> The URL of the ArgoCD instance (Run `oc get route openshift-gitops-server -n openshift-gitops` to the full route URL)
<3> Username for this ArgoCD instance. Default is `admin`
<4> Password for this ArgoCD instance.

. Upgrade the RHDH helm chart in YAML mode and enable the ArgoCD plugins:
+
```yaml
  - disabled: false
    package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/roadiehq-backstage-plugin-argo-cd
  - disabled: false
    package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/roadiehq-backstage-plugin-argo-cd-backend-dynamic
```

. Click `Upgrade` to re-deploy the chart and for the new configuration to take effect. Wait until the RHDH container is fully up and running.

. Finally, inspect the catalog YAML descriptor file for this component at https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/devhub-qc-apps/blob/main/gitops/catalog-info.yaml. Adjust the values for your environment. Note the `argocd/app-name` annotation to match the name of the `Application` resource (`spring-petclinic`).
+
```yaml
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: spring-petclinic-gitops
  title: An app deployed by OpenShift GitOps
  description: |
    This is a simple spring app deployed by OCP GitOps
  annotations:
    backstage.io/kubernetes-id: 'spring-petclinic'
    backstage.io/kubernetes-namespace: myapps
    backstage.io/kubernetes-label-selector: 'app=spring-petclinic'
    argocd/app-name: 'spring-petclinic'
spec:
...
```

. Import the component into the RHDH catalog from the `Create > REGISTER EXISTING COMPONENT` page, and provide the full path to the `catalog-info.yml` file from the previous step. After the component is imported, verify that the component is listed in the `Catalog` page and click on `An app deployed by OpenShift GitOps` to view the component details.

. Verify that you can see a new `ArgoCD overview` section in the `OVERVIEW` tab that shows the sync status and health status for this application.

. You should see a new tab named `CD` in this page. Click on it to view the historical information for the application.
